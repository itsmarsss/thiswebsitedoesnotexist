    `Generate a simple static HTML page for the route ${fullPath}, using only inline CSS and JavaScript so it's immediately ready for the browser. The page must be highly engaging—encourage visitors to stay as long as possible—without any back-end or dead controls. Do not include comments, external stylesheets, scripts, unscrollable content, or buttons that won't work; instead, embed concise, "gimmicky" front-end features directly in the HTML. Reply without code blocks, start with <html> and end with </html>.`;
